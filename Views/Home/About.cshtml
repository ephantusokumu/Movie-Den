<p>Welcome to our new site, the world’s preeminent destination for movie criticism, commentary and community. Ever since the passing of the site's co-founder and namesake, Pulitzer Prize-winning film critic Roger Ebert, in 2013, it has been run by his wife, Chaz Ebert. Chaz has been guiding the current redesign in conjunction with celebrated web developer Table XI, IT consultant, Myrin New, Ebert Company executive, Sonia Evans, and Managing Editor, Brian Tallerico to ensure that Roger's passion for movies, decades of essential reviews, and ability to connect with readers serve as the site's foundation. Chaz with her team of professional editors (Brian Tallerico, Matt Zoller Seitz, Nick Allen, Matt Fagerholm and Nell Minow), continues to maintain Roger’s high standards for providing timeless insights in cinematic discourse, while exploring the latest releases with coverage penned by a diverse array of esteemed writers. We will continue to bring not only current reviews of films from major studios, but one of the most comprehensive coverage of reviews from independent and documentary film makers, as well as reviews of leading television or cable series and shows from various streaming platforms.</p>
